# AuthOpenIDConnect - LimeSurvey Auth Plugin

## Disclaimer
This plugin is **not maintained** by me anymore.\
Feel free to create a fork if you would like to customize it.

I am really grateful for your pull requests, but as I am not working with PHP and Limesurvey anymore I can't test them and ensure that everything works fine after a merge.

If you would like to continue to maintain this project please open an issue to get in touch with me. â˜º

composer install

3. Zip the plugin with all dependencies installed.
